# Machine-Learning

The purpose of this repository is to allow someone to give a presentation on some basic aspects of machine learning, with the ultimate goal being to get the audience interested and thinking about the technology behind machine learning.

I put together a Google Slide and a script to go along with it, and tried to use examples that were interesting (Deep Blue vs. Garry Kasparov) but also easy to understand (tic-tac-toe learning algorithm).

The presentation is geared towards a little bit of a younger audience but I think anyone who doesn't know much about Machine Learning can find something interesting in it.

Thanks for looking at my submission!
